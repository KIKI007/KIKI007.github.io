We are seeking RAs, PhDs, and Postdocs to join our Robotic Fabrication Lab in the Division of Integrative Systems and Design (ISD) at HKUST. Our lab focuses on interdisciplinary research that combines AI and robotics to tackle real-world design and fabrication challenges.

This year, we are particularly interested in candidates passionate about Vision-Language-Action Models (VLA) to help develop new service robots for daily household tasks. Our team is part of the Von Neumann Institute at HKUST, equipped with two Franka Emika Panda robots and two UR10e robots.

No prior experience with robots is required, but we welcome candidates with experience in:

- Vision-Language-Action Model
- Vision-Language Model
- Diffusion Policy
- Large Language Model (Training and Fine-tuning)

Please contact me at <ziqiw@ust.hk>, attaching your resume and transcript.
